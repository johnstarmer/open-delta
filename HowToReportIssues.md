The Atlas of Living Australia is an initiative to improve access to essential information on Australiaâ€™s biodiversity by providing tools for researchers and others to access, combine and map data on Australian species. The Atlas project is a partnership between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian natural history collections community and the Australian Government.

## Defects vs Enhancements ##

**Please note**: The Atlas of Living Australia is funding reimplementation work, not enhancements to the existing DELTA functionality.
Defects in the reimplemented code will be addressed. Enhancement requests are considered beyond the scope of the current work.
You may also wish to consult the [DELTA-L mailing list](http://delta-intkey.com/www/delta-l.htm) for general DELTA related issues.
